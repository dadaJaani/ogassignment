#OpsGenie FrontEnd Technical Assignment
This project is being done in React and webpack.


##To start the project:

Type in the following command in the terminal to run:
```
npm start
```


##To Build the project using webpack:

Type in the following command in the terminal to run:
```
npm build
```

There is also a distributed file made by webpack. it is in the **root/dist** directory. The whole project can be run through the index file in that directory.




##Task Details:

1. You can use the framework you want (Angular, Vue, React)
2. We expect to have a single page application.
3. Module bundler should be used (webpack, rollup etc.)
4. We expect to have at least 2 different pages (page and / or container).
5. On the first page, list the alerts (at least 4-5 fields to choose from)
6. On the other page, we can see all the fields of an alert and also show related notes from the note file.
7. What is "page / container"? -> page, it could be modal dialog, it is up to you.



##Bonus Details:

1. We leave the visuality to you. Free on UX.
2. Alert data has a "createdAtTimestamp" field. Based on this field, you can present existing alerts on a graph. Graphically "what" and "how" should be, we leave you with details.
3. Unit test writing. Coverage must be at least 60%.
4. For basic css, you can move forward with one of the successful templates, or move forward from scratch. We will ask you to elaborate with 1-2 sentences why you choose which one.
